  abstract = {This chapter introduces its readers to the concept of tourism. It sheds light on the rationale for tourism, as it explains the tourists' inherent motivations to travel. It also describes different aspects that together make up the tourism industry. Tourists travel to destinations that are accessible to them. They require accommodation if they are visiting a place for more than 24~h. Leisure and business travellers may also visit attractions, and engage themselves in recreational activities. Hence, the tourist destinations should have the right amenitiesAmenitiesand facilities. In this light, this chapter clarifies how destinationsDestinationmay offer different products to satisfy a wide array of tourists. Tourism products can include; urban (or city) tourism,Urban tourismseaside tourismSeaside tourism, rural tourismRural tourism, ecotourismEcotourism, wine tourismWine tourism, culinary tourismCulinary tourism, health tourism,Health tourismmedical tourismMedical tourism, religious tourismReligious tourism, cultural (or heritage) Heritage tourismtourismCultural tourism, sports tourismSports tourism, educational tourismEducational tourism, business tourismBusiness tourism(including meetings, incentives, conferences and events),Meetings, incentives, conferences and eventsamong others. In conclusion, this chapter lists major points of interest in North America to clarify how diverse destinations may be appealing to different tourists, for many reasons.},

  abstract = {The Lagoon of Venice is a continuously evolving ecosystem that rapidly responds to anthropic stressors. The UNESCO World Heritage site ``Venice and its Lagoon'', is one of the top tourist destinations in the world. Mass tourism increases marine litter, water traffic emissions, solid waste, and sewage release. Plastic marine litter is not only a major aesthetic problem diminishing tourists experience of Venice, it also leaches contaminants into the seawater. Since there is a dearth in the literature regarding microplastic leachable compounds and overtourism related pollutants, the project studied the Head Space-Solid Phase Micro Extraction-Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC\textendash MS) molecular fingerprint of volatile lagoon water pollutants, to gain insight into the extent of this phenomenon in August 2019. The chromatographic analyses enabled the identification of 40 analytes related to the presence of polymers in seawater, water traffic, and tourists habits. In Italy, on the 10th March 2020, the lockdown restrictions were enforced to control the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection; the ordinary urban water traffic around Venice came to a halt, and the ever-growing presence of tourists suddenly ceased. This situation provided a unique opportunity to analyze the environmental effects of restrictions on VOCs load in the Lagoon. 17 contaminants became not detectable after the lockdown period. The statistical analysis indicated that the amounts of many other contaminants significantly dropped. The presence of 9 analytes was not statistically influenced by the lockdown restrictions, probably because of their stronger persistence or continuous input in the environment from diverse sources. Results signify a sharp and encouraging pollution decrease at the molecular level, concomitant with the anthropogenic stress release, even if it is not possible to attribute quantitatively the VOCs load variations to specific sources (e.g., tourists' habits, urban water traffic, plastic pollution).},

The transformation of the resort of Bugibba to meet the demands of these markets and to maintain competitiveness presents many, diverse challenges. The prevailing atmosphere within the resort during the first decade of the 21st century is of a town that is striving to find its contemporary identity. In common with many resorts it appears a faded reflection of its 1970s heyday and is striving to revitalise its fortunes. However, Bugibba's position as a tourist resort has been shaped by Malta's National Tourism Plans since 1989, and it is contended here that these plans are contributing to the resort's decline. Rethinking Bugibba's next phases of development is bringing about change. Meeting upmarket expectations and image provides a national steer for Bugibba, and the nature of its tourism product has started to alter, albeit slowly. However, to change perceptions of it as a traditional mass-tourism resort will be harder to achieve, and may be made even more difficult during the period of transition.},

In particular, islands that depend heavily on tourist inflows\textemdash including mass-tourism islands, and small island developing states (SIDS)\textemdash have seen their revenues diminish significantly, and poverty rates increasing. Some alternative-tourism islands have fared better, as they have focused on providing personalized, nature-based experiences to mostly domestic tourists. This article focuses on the experiences of mass-tourism islands, SIDS, and alternative-tourism islands during the COVID-19 pandemic, and offers possible post-pandemic scenarios, as well as recommendations for sustainable island tourism development. Although the pandemic has largely had a negative impact on the tourism sector, this is a unique opportunity for many islands to review the paradigm of tourism development. In this newly emerging world, and under a still very uncertain future scenario, the quadriptych of sustainability is more important than ever. Responsible governance and management of islands' natural resources and their tourism activities, addressing climate change impacts, the diversification of islands' economies, and the promotion of innovative and personalized tourist experiences are all necessary steps towards increasing islands' resilience in case of future economic downturn or health- and environment-related crises.},

  abstract = {When the COVID-19 pandemic reached the Mexican Caribbean in late March 2020, this world-renown tourist destination had already been struggling with Sargassum influxes for 5~years. The nature and magnitude of these two impacts are not directly comparable, but both have contributed to profoundly transforming the region. As extreme COVID-19 containment measures were implemented nationwide, the tourism industry contracted by 98\% as over 23 million visitors failed to arrive in 2020 and 400 daily flights stopped landing at Cancun Airport. Sargassum accumulations on Caribbean beaches, and their collection, containment and removal had been a challenging socioeconomic issue in the Caribbean region years before the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the tourist industry. We explore Beck's concept of a risk society as an approach to these socioenvironmental impacts. We analyze five premises about risk society, combining them with a mainly ethnography methodology involving 61 informants. We present the results in terms of impacts. Using the concept of trajectory based on pandemic event chronology, we review the main stages of the pandemic during the research period (May to July 2020) and how the studied population worked to prevent virus infection and spread. We employ narratives to analyze risk perception both of the Sargassum influx and the pandemic. The discussion highlights the importance of moving beyond nature/society dichotomies and dualisms. In summary, the profound transformations caused by these impacts provide a unique opportunity for the Mexican Caribbean to reconstitute itself in a way that encompasses the world risk society concept, perhaps in a more socially and environmentally resilient incarnation.},

  abstract = {The Mediterranean Sea and its coastal systems are threatened by intense anthropogenic pressures including rapid accumulation of marine litter by diverse human activities. The region, which is the world's leading touristic destination, has to face a seasonal increase of waste generation due to the seasonal influx of visitors. The beaches, extremely crowded during the summer, are particularly vulnerable since they are proven to be concentrated accumulation zones and one of the main gateways of litter to enter the marine system. We found that the accumulation rates of marine litter on Mediterranean island beaches follow a seasonal pattern, increasing up to 4.7 times during the high season, representing a daily load of (40.6\,{$\pm$}\,11.5) 106 items/day extrapolated to all the islands of the region. We developed an accumulation index to assess the dynamics of marine litter and support efficient mitigation strategies by local authorities. To limit marine litter production attributable to recreational activities, a series of pilot actions implemented during the high touristic season, demonstrated a substantial reduction (up to 52.5\%). The implementation towards an efficient and sustainable tourism business model is urgently required.},

It proposes that local knowledge sources and intra-organizational collaboration determine the probability of producing incremental innovations, and that non-local knowledge sources determine the introduction of radical innovations. Design/methodology/approach Descriptive statistics made it possible to evaluate the importance of each of the external sources as the origin of ideas for innovation. Principal component analysis was used to find homogeneous groups based on the different knowledge sources contemplated. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine which variables predict a hotel's capacity to introduce innovations. Findings The findings suggest a dissociation between innovations adopted by directly incorporating the specific knowledge provided by external agents and innovations that require the mediation of intra-organizational collaboration for their development. Research limitations/implications Future qualitative studies can provide data that would considerably improve the understanding of how innovation processes are produced in hotel companies based on the use of external knowledge and how hotel firms develop spaces to exchange and combine internal knowledge. Practical implications Hotel firms can adopt innovations by incorporating specific knowledge from external companies or by developing their own innovations based on information gathered from external agents or events (e.g. customers, attending trade fairs and professional conferences). The transformation of this information into innovations requires the establishment of internal communication channels that foment employees' collaboration and exchange of information. Originality/value The study provides empirical evidence for the relevant role played by both external agents and intra-organizational relationships as sources of knowledge to foster innovation in hotel firms. External agents are classified as local and non-local sources, and their effect on innovation is analyzed, distinguishing between incremental and radical innovations.},

However, the island since 1971 has moved in the direction of a ``deliberate'' AT policy, emphasizing the attractiveness of its mountainous and forested interior to a growing ecotourist market. Current tourism growth and development in Dominica appears to be occuring in a way that conforms with the philosophy of deliberate AT.
