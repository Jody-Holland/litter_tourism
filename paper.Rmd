Thus, when restrictions eased, many islands eagerly accommodated mass tourism, seeing it as low investment, high yield, and reliable model of raising much needed revenue. Yet, as mentioned, there are significant negative consequences to mass tourism. Mass tourism has been attributed to overcrowding, particularly on coastal areas. As a consequence, locals may be "spaced out" of public areas such as beaches
