The basic goal of this research project is explore relationships between the visitor profile of beaches on Fuerteventura and the level of litter left upon them. To achieve this several datasets need to be employed. To build a demographic profile, ideally, we would be able to access mobility data from mobile devices across the island. In this way I would be able to determine the visitor profile of each beach in terms of nationality, age, and length of stay. This would enable in depth inferences regarding the type of people visiting each beach. However, this data may be hard to access. As a result it is prudent to explore alternative options. One option may be looking at search term data for the various beaches from different countirs over the 2021. This may unlock serveral important insights such as the level o finterest in each beach.

This might involve looking at the location tagging of images such as on Flickr or Instagram. It may also involve language based analysis of reviews from each beach.
